The [billstclair/elm-xml-rss](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-xml-rss/latest) package is an add-on to the [eeue56/elm-xml](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/eeue56/elm-xml/latest) package for parsing [Really Simple Syndication](http://backend.userland.com/rss092) (RSS).

This is a work in progress. It currently contains the source for `eeue56/elm-xml`, because the [0.19 upgrade](https://github.com/billstclair/elm-xml-eeue56) of that project has not yet been published. I'll remove that before publishing this.
